Things I learned

I learnt that the responsiveness of a webpage can depend on more than the media queries.
I learnt how to use more flex variations and properties.
I learnt more on the effects of the opacity of an image can have to a color.
I  learnt about the word spacing property in css

These are some of some lines of code that I am happy with.

```html
 <div class="imgContainer">
    <img src="./images/image-header-desktop.jpg">
</div>```
```css
..card { 
    ......
    flex-direction: row-reverse;
    margin: 5% auto;
    ......
}
```
Continued development

I intend to keep working on my html and css skills. Although I already have experience in several languages some include C#, Java and C. I believe that it is best to gain expertise and be the best i can posibly be at one language than to remain only average at several others. 

Useful resources

- [For Responsiveness](https://www.codeinfoweb.com/2021/03/Responsive%20Cards.html) - This is an easy to understand blog that helped me figure out why my media queriescould not make my website responsive alone. 

- [Original](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) - This the tool that gave me the idea to make this. I strongly reccomend it for any one trying to grow their skills and portfolio as a front-end developer
